# Typing Speed Test Program

This is a simple Python-based typing speed test program. The program prompts the user to type a given paragraph or set of words, calculates the typing speed (in words per minute) and accuracy of the user's typing, and then displays the results to the user.

## How to Use

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your machine.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the program's directory in your terminal: `$ cd typing_speed_test_program`
4. Run the program: `$ python3 .`

That's it! The program will randomly select a paragraph from the `assets/paragraphs.txt` file, shuffle the words, and prompt you to start typing. Once you've completed typing, the program will display your results, including your typing speed, accuracy, and time taken.

Happy typing!
